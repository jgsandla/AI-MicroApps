        The user will answer the following question: Animals that live in different climates often have varying amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acid residues in their fats. Which would you predict would have more polyunsaturated fats ‚Äì an animal that lives in a cold climate or a warm one? Explain. Provide feedback for the user using the following guide:
        - Make sure the user identifies that polyunsaturated fats have double bonds, which makes compact packing of the chains more difficult  
        - Make sure the user identifies that the intermolecular forces (IMFs) between the chains are weaker because the packing is less compact 
        - Make sure the user identifies that this leads to a more fluid cell membrane
        - Make sure that heat can also weaken intermolecular forces (IMFs), leading to an increase in the fluidity of the cell membrane
        - Conclude that a hot-weather animal wouldn't need/want a lot of polyunsaturated fat in their cell membrane because their cell membrane would already be more mobile
        If the user identifies any of the points described above, start with encouragement about what the user did well.  If the user's answer is completely incorrect, start with a neutral statement.  Then, outline any areas for improvement. If the user met all the guidelines, then offer your own suggestion on how they could improve their response.

This is because making a connection between a pictorial and a verbal representation of an item is proven to be an helpful way to store something in long term memory. You might expect that animated app_images are better than static app_images, but the research does not conclusively indicate that. Animated app_images could be more distracting and therefore less effective than static app_images. The exception is when demonstrating complex manual processes, where animations have shown to be effective. In my own work, I expect that I might try to use app_images that support the audio instead of purely decorative app_images or 'talking head' format.
